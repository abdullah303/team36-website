                  During our first week, we dedicated ourselves to thoroughly researching the project and gathering all necessary 
                  information about our target users. To do this, we conducted a series of observations and interviews over the course 
                  of the week to gather insights and develop a clear understanding of the people who would be using our product.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Based on the information we gathered, we then created personas that represent the various types of users who would be utilizing our 
                  product. This exercise allowed us to get a deeper understanding of the project and the specific needs and requirements of our target 
                  users. By having this information, we were able to design our prototype in a way that was tailored specifically to meet the needs of 
                  the people who would be using it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, our research efforts during week one helped us to lay the foundation for our project and set us up for success moving forward.
                  We gained knowledge about our target audience and the requirements they have, which will be essential as we move forward 
                  with developing and refining our prototype.

                  During our second week, we turned our attention to developing the prototype for our project. With the information we gathered 
                  about user requirements and the progress made on our HCI report, we had a much clearer understanding of the direction we wanted 
                  to take with our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To bring our ideas to life, we used Figma, a powerful and user-friendly collaborative software. With Figma, we were able to 
                  create a wireframe representation of our prototype, which gave us a visual representation of how our project would function and 
                  look. This was an essential step in the development process as it allowed us to refine our ideas and make any necessary changes 
                  before moving forward with the next stages of development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, our focus during week two was all about bringing our prototype to life. By utilizing Figma and creating a wireframe 
                  representation of our project, we were able to take significant steps forward in the development process and bring our ideas 
                  one step closer to becoming a reality.

                  During week three of our project, our main objective was to make sure that our prototype and HCI report were of the 
                  highest quality before submission.
                  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once our prototype and HCI report were finalized and submitted, we turned our attention to beginning work on our 
                  literature review. Our literature review was focused on researching Architectural CAD walkthroughs and PseudoVR. 
                  This research was crucial in helping us determine the most appropriate CAD software for our study, which turned 
                  out to be SketchUp and AutoCAD.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Working on this literature review allowed us to dive deeper into the understanding of our
                   project and gain a better understanding of how we should approach its implementation. By conducting this research, 
                   we were able to identify the key factors that would impact the success of our project and develop a plan for moving 
                   forward that was informed by the best practices and principles of our field.

                  During week four of our project, we recognized the importance of staying organized and focusing on the administrative 
                  side of things. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  To accomplish this, we began building the project website and uploading all necessary information and documentation. 
                  This included our HCI report, literature review, prototype, and any other relevant materials. Having all of this 
                  information in one central location was essential in helping us stay organized and informed throughout the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another key aspect of staying on track was making sure that we were following our project plan. 
                  To accomplish this, we created a Gantt chart which helped us to monitor our progress and allocate time efficiently. 
                  With this, we were able to see exactly where we stood in relation to our project timeline, and make any necessary 
                  adjustments to keep us on track.

                  During the development phase of our project website, we recognized the importance of familiarizing ourselves with 
                  the SketchUp and AutoCAD software. This was necessary as we needed to be able to effectively navigate the workspace and 
                  perform various functions. To ensure that we had a solid understanding of these programs, we took the time to make 
                  a list of all the commands used for each feature. This allowed us to implement the functionality for each feature 
                  separately and efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to familiarizing ourselves with SketchUp and AutoCAD, we also spent time getting familiar with the MotionInput
                   source code. This was a completely new area for us, and it was crucial that we understood how it worked in order to make 
                   progress on our project. By taking the time to understand these programs, this ensured we were able to 
                   begin the designing and implementation process.
