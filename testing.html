       <h3>Limited dictionaries:</h3>
    <p>
        During the process of testing our program on both Autocad and Sketchup, we encountered some obstacles related to 
        speech recognition. The issues we faced included the program often detecting incorrect words or picking up a lot 
        of background noise, making it more challenging to use.
        To overcome these challenges, we decided to create specific dictionaries for each software that we used. For example, 
        we developed a Sketchup-specific dictionary that only contained words necessary for the softwares features. This 
        approach allowed us to map other words to 'unk,' which prevented the program from misinterpreting them. We also found 
        that the detection of specific commands became more accurate by mapping words like 'orbiting' to 'orbit,' providing users 
        with greater flexibility in their use of speech commands.
        One of the main advantages of developing these separate dictionaries is that you can easily switch between them. 
        For instance, users can change dictionaries by saying "switch dictionary Autocad." Additionally, since Autocad and Tinkercad 
        have different lists of features, creating separate dictionaries for each software helped to increase accuracy in the use 
        of speech commands.
        After implementing these measures, we observed a significant improvement in program performance, with a 35% increase in accuracy, 
        and almost all words were accurately detected. The overall operation of the program also became much smoother, providing a more 
        seamless user experience.

        <h3>Facial calibration:</h3>
    <p>
        During our testing phase, we encountered a problem related to the accuracy of our facial navigation feature. It was only 
        successful in accurately identifying 20% of the users, as it was unresponsive for some while being overly sensitive for others. 
        This made it challenging to use, and we realised that it required a performance boost to improve user experience.
        To address this issue, we decided to implement the facial calibration feature to tailor facial navigation specifically to the user's 
        face. The primary objective of this feature is to simplify the facial navigation process by ensuring that the program is accurately 
        calibrated for each individual's unique facial features.
        This feature includes a series of screens that prompt users to move certain parts of their face, which are typically used in facial 
        navigation. This calibration process helps the program adjust its sensitivity levels based on the scope of the user's facial expressions, 
        making it more precise and accurate. 
        During the implementation of the facial calibration feature, we encountered a few challenges during its execution. Firstly, during the 
        calibration process, the program required the user to look all the way to the side, which prevented them from seeing if the screen had 
        changed yet. However, we later discovered that the feature included a sound notification that indicated the completion of each mode of 
        calibration. This sound made it easier for the user to track their progress during the calibration process and eliminated the issue of 
        not being able to see the screen.
        However, after successfully calibrating the facial navigation feature, we discovered that some of its functions, such as dragging, 
        became more difficult to use. Additionally, the fps (frames per second) dropped, which caused navigation to become less smooth. This 
        decrease in functionality and usability could make the feature impractical to use in architectural CAD software.
        Overall, although there are some places that need improvement, facial navigation became 2x more accurate than before.
